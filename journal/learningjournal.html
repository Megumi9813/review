        <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
        <p>To me, growth mindset is always seek evolution and never get tired of the status quo, and find effective ways to reach your desires and long-term goals.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Openness</li>
                <p>Openness is one of the five personality traits of the Big Five personality theory. It indicates how open-minded a person is. A person with a high level of openness to experience in a personality test enjoys trying new things. They are imaginative, curious, and open-minded. Individuals who are low in openness to experience would rather not try new things. They are close-minded, literal and enjoy having a routine.</p>
            <li>Inclusivity</li>
                <p>the quality of trying to include many different types of people and treat them all fairly and equally</p>
            <li>Ambition and Initiative</li>
                <p>Initiative is the act of starting something. It’s someone taking her first steps and putting herself out there. And it’s a good thing for leaders to have. However, too much of it—like too much of many qualities—can be a negative. If a person has too much initiative and not enough ambition, he is always starting, always taking those first steps, but never actually following through on his project and goals. In order to truly see something through to completion, she, and all great leaders, needs to be ambitious.</p>
