                In 2018, I was in Kyoto and having a lot of fun but, at the same
                time I was kinda get bored to unlimited free time as a
                university student. Then I decided to go to Philippines for 3
                months. I've stayed in Cebu and I love all the things in Cebu
                people, beautifle ocean and culture.

                My university is in Kyoto, called "Doshisya". It's private
                school and has over 20,000 students. Actually, it wasn't my
                first choice but, now I'd say this choice was definitely right
                for me. Especially location is amazing.

                After I stay in Philippine, I was pretty confident about my
                speaking skills in Engkish which was totally
                overconfidence...lol. Then I decided to move to vancouver only
                for a year. However I'm still in Vancouver somehow.

                I used to play badminton, Pingpong, Tennis, and swimming. For
                badminton I still play in Vancouver everyweek. Also, I'm big fun
                of SoftBank Hawks which is professional baseball tean in
                Fukuoka. I love this team just because they're from Fukuoka
                where is right next to my hometown but, apparently they're
                pretty strong.
